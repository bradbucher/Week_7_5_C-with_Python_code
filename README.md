Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

To build an item tracking program for the Corner Grocer utilizing C++ and Python code. The program needs to analyze the items sold throughout the day to rearrange their store to better serve their customers. The three main requirements are:
1.	Produce a list of all items purchased in a given day along with the number of times each item was purchased.
2.	Produce a number representing how many times a specific item was purchased in a given day.
3.	Produce a text-based histogram listing all items purchased in a given day, along with a representation of the number of times each item was purchased.

What did you do particularly well?
The programming portion in C++ was done well. 

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could have set up for using Python better. The dictionary was removed from Python and the Python code wasn’t setting the values into the dictionary, so the frequency file was always empty. If I would have set up Python properly and not removed the dictionary from the Python code the program would have functioned properly.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The Python code was difficult for me. I used Tutors to help me with the areas I was having issues on but they didn’t help me as much as I thought. I had a Python Tutor go through all my Python code and he told me it was solid. Now I know that wasn’t the case. I am adding GitHub and stack overflow to my support network.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The C++ code was good, and I will be able to use portions in other projects.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to use notes in with my code to explain my steps and standards so it would flow in a natural process.
